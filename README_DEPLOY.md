✅ **Easy updates** - Just deploy new version

**iPhone/iPad:**
1. Open your app in Safari
2. Tap Share button
3. Tap "Add to Home Screen"
4. Done! App icon appears on home screen

**Android:**
1. Open your app in Chrome
2. Tap menu (3 dots)
3. Tap "Install App" or "Add to Home Screen"
4. Done! App icon appears on home screen
