# App Icons Needed

To make your PWA fully functional, you need to add these icon files to the `public` folder:

1. `icon-192.png` - 192x192 pixels
2. `icon-512.png` - 512x512 pixels

## Quick Way to Generate Icons:

1. Create a 512x512 logo/image for your app
2. Use one of these tools:
   - https://realfavicongenerator.net/
   - https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator
   - https://github.com/onderceylan/pwa-asset-generator

3. Download the generated icons
4. Place them in the `public` folder

## Temporary Solution:

You can use any 192x192 and 512x512 images for now. The app will work, but icons won't look perfect.

For a baseball theme, consider:
- Baseball icon
- Bat and ball
- Stadium silhouette
- Your app logo
